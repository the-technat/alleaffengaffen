## Image

There's an image available to use as demo-app: `ghcr.io/the-technat/alleaffengaffen:latest`

It should work with almost all security best-practices.

## Update

Run: `hugo mod get -u` to update the gallery.

Additionally there's an ENV var in `.github/workflows/hugo.yml` to update the used hugo version when building.
